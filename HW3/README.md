### What are the advantages and disadvantages of the 256 bit word length in the EVM ###

**Advantages:**
Allows for very large integer operations, benefiting high precision arithmetic as it mitigates underflow/overflow errors within this length.
It can work with cryptographic operations directly given that the EVM uses Keccak-256.

**Disadvantages:**
Smaller data types like uint32 or uint8 still occupy a full 256-bit slot and this can lead to storage inefficiencies. In order to optimize the use of smaller data types you can pack them into a struct or use bit manipulation on a uint256 via bitwise operations and shifts.


### What would happen if the implementation of a precompiled contract varied between Ethereum clients? ###


### Write a simple contract that uses a memory variable, then using the Remix debugger step through the function and inspect the memory. ###
